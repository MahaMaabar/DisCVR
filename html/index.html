<h1>Welcome to DisCVR’s documentation!<a class="headerlink" href="#welcome-to-discvr-s-documentation" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>DisCVR is a viral detection tool which allows the identification of known human viruses in clinical
samples from high-throughput sequencing (HTS) data. It uses the k-mers approach in which the
sample reads are decomposed into <em>k</em>-mers and then matched against a virus k-mers database. The
built-in database is a list consists of all <em>k</em>-mers (<em>k</em>=22) that are not low-complexity and only found in
the viral genomes but not in the human genome. Each <em>k</em>-mer is assigned the taxonomic label of all
viral genomes that contain that <em>k</em>-mer in the NCBI taxonomy tree. These assignments are made at the
species and strains taxonomic level.</p>
<p>DisCVR has a user-friendly Graphical User Interface (GUI) which runs the analysis on the sample and
shows the results interactively. It enables the visualisation of the coverage of the virus genomes found
in the sample in order to validate the significance of the results. In addition, DisCVR is a generic tool
which can be used with other non-human viruses by facilitating the build and use of customised kmers
database.</p>
<p>DisCVR is designed to run on machines with low processing capacity and small memory.</p>

<ul class="simple">
<li><strong>Disk Space</strong>: DisCVR.jar requires <strong>~700MB space</strong> for installation with the built-in databases. It is
recommended to have space for 2x sample size when using DisCVR for classification as the
process involves writing temporary files to disk. When building a customised database, the
amount of space depends on the size of the viral sequences and the <em>k</em> size. For example,
extracting <em>k</em>-mers of size 32 from the human genomes generates a file that is 80GB in size. If
the viral data sequences are 3GB in size, then the minimum disk space needed to build a
customised database is 200GB.</li>
<li><strong>Memory</strong>: DisCVR runs efficiently on a machine with <strong>4GB RAM</strong>, which is the current standard
for PCs. It is much faster on machines with higher RAM such as 8GB RAM. However, the
amount of RAM depends on the number of the sequences used and the size of the k-mer. The
larger the dataset and the k-mer, the larger the amount of RAM needed. Therefore, in the
case of “out of memory” errors, the Java heap space should be increased.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="installation">
<h1>Installation<a class="headerlink" href="#installation" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<ul>
<li><p class="first">Operating System: DisCVR runs on both Windows and Linux platforms. To use DisCVR, the
users need first to download the appropriate folder for their operating system.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://bioinformatics.cvr.ac.uk/DisCVR/Downloads/DisCVR_Windows.zip">Windows OS (771Mb)</a></li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://bioinformatics.cvr.ac.uk/DisCVR/Downloads/DisCVR_Linux.tar.gz">Linux OS (786Mb)</a></li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://bioinformatics.cvr.ac.uk/DisCVR/Downloads/DisCVR_Mac.tar.gz">Mac OS (793Mb)</a></li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://bioinformatics.cvr.ac.uk/DisCVR/Downloads/DisCVR_CL.jar">Command-line for multiple classifications (645Mb)</a></li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/centre-for-virus-research/DisCVR">View source codes on GitHub</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Java: Java (1.8 or above) must be installed and the full path to the jre/bin folder should be
included in the system variables. Java can be downloaded from:
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jre8-downloads-2133155.html">Link to Oracle</a></p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">DisCVR.jar: After downloading the DisCVR zipped folder, it is recommended to use a tool, such
as 7-zip, to unzip the Windows OS version and extract all files to a local directory. For Linux
and Mac version, open a command prompt and move to the location of the zipped folder.
Type the following commands to unzip the folder:
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">tar</span> <span class="pre">-xzvf</span> <span class="pre">DisCVR_Linux.tar.gz</span></code></p>
<p>This creates a folder, called DisCVR. The contents of DisCVR consists of one jar: DisCVR.jar and
a lib folder which are used to run the classification. The script file: downloadDataAndRefSeq.sh
and the folders: bin, customisedDB, and TestData which are needed to build a customised
database.</p>
<p><strong>IMPORTANT</strong>: The full path to DisCVR directory must NOT contain space nor the dot ‘.’ to avoid
conflict with the files naming during the classification process.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Dependencies: DisCVR uses external libraries such as KAnalyze, for k-mers counting, and
JFreechart packages, for graphs plotting. It makes use of Tanoti, a Blast-based tool for
reference assembly. These are 10 files in total and they are in the lib folder. It is important
not to alter the lib folder or its contents and to ensure that it is in the same path as the jar file.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="testing">
<h1>Testing<a class="headerlink" href="#testing" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>To test if the tools are installed properly, open a command prompt and type the following:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>To know what Java version is installed: <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">java</span> <span class="pre">–version</span></code>.

<h1>DisCVR Built-in Databases<a class="headerlink" href="#discvr-built-in-databases" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>DisCVR tool has three virus <em>k</em>-mers (k=22) databases which are built into the DisCVR.jar:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Human Hemorrhagic virus dataset (hemorrhagic dataset)</li>
<li>Human Respiratory virus dataset (respiratory dataset)</li>
<li>Human Pathogenic viruses dataset (pathogenic dataset)</li>
</ol>
<p>The hemorrhagic and respiratory datasets consist of a list of selected circulating viruses.
The pathogenic datatset consist of a list of all human pathogenic viruses identified as biological agents by the
Health and Safety Executive (HSE) in the UK available at: <a class="reference external" href="http://www.hse.gov.uk/pubns/misc208.pdf">http://www.hse.gov.uk/pubns/misc208.pdf</a></p>
<p>Both the hemorrhagic and respiratory datasets overlap with the HSE database but are smaller in size and therefore are faster to use in classification.
Moreover, each dataset has a list of viral reference genomes that is associated with the viruses in the database. The reference genomes are used in the validation stage of DisCVR.
Information about the viruses in the databases can be obtained from the Database icon on the menu bar from the DisCVR GUI. The information includes the virus rank on the taxonomy tree,
the number of sequences used in the database build to represent it, and the accession number of its reference genome. Segmented viruses have their reference genome accession number listed
in decreasing order of the segment size. The accession numbers of the reference genomes are linked to their webpages on the NCBI, which can be viewed by clicking on the reference genome accession.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="discvr-classification">
<h1>DisCVR Classification<a class="headerlink" href="#discvr-classification" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>The DisCVR GUI can be used to carry out a single sample classification. To launch the DisCVR GUI, either double click on DisCVR.jar, or
open a command prompt and type the following commands:</p>
<div class="highlight-bash notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="nb">cd</span> full/path/to/DisCVR folder
java –jar full/path/to/DisCVR.jar
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Once DisCVR is launched, there are 4 panels in the graphical interface:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Progress Bar: shows the progression of the classification process.</li>
<li>Input Sources: allows the user to choose the sample file and a <em>k</em>-mers database for classification.</li>
<li>Classification Results: shows the classification output in three sub-panels.</li>
<li>Progress Information: updates the user about classification output.</li>
</ol>
<p>To start a classification process, the user needs to first select the sample file they wish to
investigate. Currently, DisCVR supports .fasta, .fa, .fastq, and .fq formats. It allows for the selection
of one file hence, for paired-end files, it is recommended to concatenate both files. The second step is to
choose the database for the classification. The default setting is to select one of the three built-in databases.
This sets the <em>k</em>-mer size to 22 and removes all sample <em>k</em>-mers with entropy ≤ 2.5. On the other hand, if the user
chooses to use a customised database for the classification, then the box next to the <a class="reference internal" href="#customised-database"><span class="std std-ref">Customised Database</span></a> label
must be checked. The fields for this selection are then activated for the user to upload the customised database
file, which MUST be in the customisedDB folder that is in the same path as DisCVR.jar. The <em>k</em>-mer size for the
classification is extracted from the database name and the threshold to filter out low-entropy <em>k</em>-mers from the
sample should be entered in its corresponding field. The entropy threshold should be the same value used in the
build of the customised database which is recommended to be in the range of [0, 3.0]. If the users choose not to
specify a value for the entropy threshold then the default value of 2.5 is displayed in the field and used in the
classification.</p>
<p>Once, the database library is selected, the user clicks the classify button to start the classification process.</p>
<p>There are 4 stages in the classification process and the progress bar is updated after the completion of each stage.
Messages in relation to the output of each stage are displayed in the progress information panel.
This includes the number of reads in the sample, the number of distinct <em>k</em>-mers and their total counts in
the database and the sample file, the number of sample <em>k</em>-mers after removing single copies and low entropy
<em>k</em>-mers, and the number of classified <em>k</em>-mers and their total counts. The final message shows the number of
viruses with classified <a href="#id1"><span class="problematic" id="id2">*</span></a>k*mers found in the sample and the time taken to finish the classification process.

<p>At the end of the classification process, the progress information panel states the number of viruses with matched <em>k</em>-mers to the database.
Detailed information about the classification results are displayed on the centre panel.</p>
<p>The classification results panel consists of three sub-panels: Scoring, Summary, and Full Analysis. Once the classification is completed, a bar
chart showing up the top three viruses is displayed on the scoring panel. These are the viruses with the most number of classified distinct <em>k</em>-mers
found in the sample. The chart shows for each virus, the number of distinct <em>k</em>-mers that are specific to the virus as well as the number of shared
<em>k</em>-mers with other viruses in the sample, which are referred to as non-specific <em>k</em>-mers. The Summary panel gives a list of the viruses found in the
sample along with their number of specific and non-specific distinct <em>k</em>-mers. The Full Analysis panel shows a table with taxonomic and detailed
information about the viruses with classified <em>k</em>-mers from the sample. The results are shown in the table such that the first row shows the virus
with the highest number of <em>k</em>-mers found in the sample. However, the users can click on any column heading to sort out the results in the table
according to the information in the column. The full analysis table consists of 8 columns:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Virus Name: the scientific name for the virus taking from the NCBI names.dmp file.</li>
<li>Taxa ID: the taxonomy identification for the virus in the NCBI taxonomy tree.</li>
<li>Virus Rank: the rank of the virus according to the NCBI nodes.dmp file.</li>

<h1>Output Validation<a class="headerlink" href="#output-validation" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>DisCVR allows the validation of the classification output using the reference-assembly technique to assess significance of matches.
During the build of the virus <em>k</em>-mer database in DisCVR, a library that contains the complete reference genomes of some of the viruses,
which are represented by <em>k</em>-mers in the database, is generated. The tool allows two validations using the extracted reference genome library:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><em>k</em>-mer Assembly: maps all classified <em>k</em>-mers to a reference genome.</li>
</ol>
<p>2. Read Assembly: maps all sequence reads to a reference genome using Tanoti (a BLAST-guided
aligner).</p>
<p>The validation takes place from the Full Analysis panel when the user right-clicks on the virus, which they wish to validate. A list with two
items: <em>k</em>-mer Assembly and Read Assembly appears and once the user makes a selection, the reference-assembly starts. When the alignment is
finished, a line graph showing the coverage and depth of the sequence data in the sample is displayed. A full coverage of the reference genome
indicates strong evidence for the presence of the virus in the sample. The graphs can be saved as a PNG file for future reference. Figure 3
shows an example of the validation stage and its outputs.</p>

<h1>DisCVR Command Line<a class="headerlink" href="#discvr-command-line" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>DisCVR can be used to classify multiple samples at once using the command line. In this case, a folder is generated containing the
results for each sample in a separate .csv file. The results consist of information about the reads in the sample and the full analysis
of matched <em>k</em>-mers.
The jar called DisCVR_CL.jar is used to run classifications on more than one file. Refer to the Installation section to download and install the jar and ensure that it is on the same path as <em>DisCVR.jar</em> and the <em>lib</em> folder.
The following command can be used to run DisCVR_CL.jar to classify multiple files.</p>
<div class="highlight-bash notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>java –jar full/path/to/DisCVR_CL.jar &lt;samples folder&gt; &lt;k&gt; &lt;file format&gt; &lt;Database name&gt; &lt;database option&gt; &lt;entropy threshold&gt;

<p>&lt;samples folder&gt;: is the full path to the folder which contains sample files to be classified.
&lt;k&gt;: is the <em>k</em>-mer size.  If using the DisCVR built-in database, use 22
&lt;file format&gt;: is the format of the sample files e.g. fastq
&lt;database name&gt;: is the name of the database to be used in the classification. If DisCVR’s built-in database is to be used then use <em>HaemorrhagicVirusDB_22</em>, <em>RespiratoryVirusDB_22</em>, or <em>HSEVirusDB_22</em>. In case of a customisedDB, the full path to the database file must be provided.
&lt;database option&gt;: if it is one of DisCVR’s database then use <em>BuiltInDB</em> and if it is a customised database file then use <em>customisedDB</em>.
&lt;entropy threshold&gt;: is the threshold to use to remove low- entropy <em>k</em>-mers. If using DisCVR’s built-in database, for consistency use 2.5.</p>
<p>Using the command line, DisCVR enables the analysis of multiple clinical samples, however
validation of the results via reference genome alignment is not available at this stage.</p>

<p><em>Table 1: Files and parameters needed to build DisCVR’s customised database</em></p>
<p>The process starts by providing a list of the viruses of interest and the information of their complete genomes, if they exist. This input is a tab-delimited
file which contains the taxonomy ID of the virus and the accession number for its reference sequence. In DisCVR, the three built-in databases use only human
viral sequences at the species and subspecies levels on the taxonomy tree. However, the customised-database does not require the viruses to be of a particular
rank in the taxonomy tree nor the host to be human. In addition, the input file should not have duplicate taxonomy IDs but multiple taxonomy IDs in the list
can have the same reference sequence. Table 2 shows an example of the input file.</p>
<p><strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> the accession number of the virus reference sequence MUST be the exact accession number provided in the header of the reference sequence.</p>
<p>There are three steps to build the customised database which must be executed sequentially:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Data Download; which involves obtaining the data required to build the two database files.</li>
<li>Generating the reference genome library file using the information of the reference sequences.</li>
<li>Generating the virus <em>k</em>-mers database from the downloaded sequences.</li>

<div class="section" id="data-download">
<h2>Data Download<a class="headerlink" href="#data-download" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The first step in building the database is to obtain the viral sequences for the viruses of interest. The script downloadDataAndRefSeq.sh
uses the eutilities tools to download the data from the NCBI using the following command:</p>
<div class="highlight-bash notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>bash downloadDataAndRefSeq.sh &lt;taxIDs_List&gt; &lt;outputDir&gt;
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>&lt;taxIDs_List&gt;: the input file which contains the virus taxonomy IDs and their reference sequence information.
&lt;outputDir&gt;: the name of the directory for the downloaded data.</p>
<p>After executing the script, the output directory will have two sub-directories:</p>
<ol class="lowerroman simple">
<li><strong>DataSeq</strong> which contains the data to be used to build the virus <em>k</em>-mers file, and</li>
<li><strong>RefSeq</strong> which contains the data to create the reference sequence library file.</li>
</ol>
<p>Each file in both directories includes in its name the taxonomy ID (taxID) of the virus whose data is
contained in the file. The <strong>DataSeq</strong> directory has two corresponding files for each taxID:</p>
<ol class="lowerroman simple">
<li>Virus_taxID.fa is a fasta file which contains all complete and partial viral sequences for the virus with the taxID, and</li>
<li>Virus_taxID_Info which contains information for the sequences in the corresponding fasta file. The first line states the number of sequences found on NCBI for the taxID followed by information for each sequence. This includes Accession number, title, gi header, update date, length of the sequence, the subtype, and strain.</li>
</ol>
<p>Similarly, the <strong>RefSeq</strong> directory contains files for each taxID which has information of its reference sequence in the input file.
The files which are called Virus_taxID_RefSeq.fa are fasta files that contain one or more sequences (in the case of segmented viruses).
Information files are used to identify segmented viruses, in the case of <strong>RefSeq</strong>, and to filter out shared sequences, in the case of <strong>DataSeq</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> ensure that the files in both RefSeq and DataSeq folders are NOT empty. If any of the file are empty, re-run the data download
script with an input file that contains only the information for the taxIDs with empty files.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="database-files-generation">
<h2>Database Files Generation<a class="headerlink" href="#database-files-generation" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Java programs are used to generate the two files in the database. These Java programs are found in the folder called ‘bin’.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="reference-genome-library">
<h2>Reference Genome Library<a class="headerlink" href="#reference-genome-library" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The reference genome library file is used in the validation stage of DisCVR and it contains the reference sequences for the viruses
in the input file. The reference sequences are identified in the input file by their accession numbers and the corresponding sequences are
downloaded in the RefSeq directory. The Java program <em>GenomesLibrary</em> is used to generate the reference genome library using the following command:</p>
<div class="highlight-bash notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>java –cp ./bin customdatabase.GenomesLibrary &lt;taxIDs_List&gt; &lt;database_Name&gt; &lt;RefSeq_Dir&gt;
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>&lt;taxIDs_List&gt;: the input file which contains the virus taxonomy IDs and their reference sequence information.
&lt;database_Name&gt;: is the name to be given to the customised database
&lt; RefSeq_Dir &gt;: is the full path of the RefSeq folder which contains all downloaded data for the reference sequences.</p>
<p>The output file is called: databaseName_referenceGenomesLibrary and it is in the <strong>RefSeq</strong> folder. Each line in the file consists of
a virus taxonomy ID, the header, and the sequence of its complete genome. The delimiter “&#64;” is used to separate the three components.
In the case where the reference sequence is a concatenation of multiple segments, the headers are separated by a comma and the sequences
are separated by a sequence, 300 in length, of the letter N. For the viruses which share the same reference sequence (i.e. species level
and their sublevels are assigned the same reference sequence) then their taxonomy IDs are separated with a pipe sign “|”.</p>
<p>The output file MUST be copied to the <em>customisedDB</em> folder to be used for DisCVR’s validation when using the customised <em>k</em>-mers database.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="virus-k-mers-database">
<h2>Virus <em>k</em>-mers database<a class="headerlink" href="#virus-k-mers-database" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The last step to build the customised database is to generate the file which contains the virus <em>k</em>-mers. In the generation of DisCVR’s
built-in database files, a filtering step was used to remove shared sequences between a virus and its ancestors in the taxonomy tree.
This is an optional step which can be used in the build of the customised database to reduce redundancy in the data and to increase virus
specificity.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="data-filtering-optional">
<h2>Data Filtering (Optional)<a class="headerlink" href="#data-filtering-optional" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The filtering process removes shared sequences from the ancestors’ data. For example, if sequences are found in both the strain and the species
levels, then they are removed from the sequences at the species level. It is recommended to keep a copy of the data in the <strong>DataSeq</strong> directory
before executing this step to avoid loss of data. The NCBI dump files (i.e. names.dmp and nodes.dmp) are used in this step and they MUST be
included in the customisedDB folder. The Java program DataSequences is used to filter the downloaded sequences using the following commands:</p>
<div class="highlight-bash notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>mkdir &lt;DataSeq_filtered&gt;
cp -r &lt;DataSeq_Dir&gt; &lt;DataSeq_filtered&gt;
java –cp ./bin customdatabase.DataSequences &lt;DataSeq_Dir&gt; &lt;genomes_file&gt; &lt;database_Name&gt;
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>&lt; DataSeq_Dir&gt;: is the full path for the DataSeq folder which contains the viruses’ data (fasta and Info files).
&lt;DataSeq_filtered&gt;: is the full path for the folder which contains the filtered data.
&lt;genomes_file&gt;: is the full path for the referenceGenomeLibrary which is generated from the previous step.
&lt;database_Name&gt;: is the name to be given to the customised database.</p>
<p>After executing the program, the sequence files (i.e. fasta files) for the viruses which are ranked at a higher taxonomic level to
other sequences in the <strong>DataSeq</strong> directory are modified, if they contain shared sequences. The output file: databaseName_lineageID.txt
shows, per line, the taxID of a virus followed by the taxIDs of higher taxonomic level. In addition, a file which contains summary
information about the viruses in the database such as their rank in the taxonomy tree and the number of sequences per virus, after
filtering, is generated. The file is called: databaseName_DataInformation.csv.</p>
<p>Finally, an output file called: databaseName_allSeqData is generated and it contains all the sequences, after filtering, from
all the data files in the directory. The three output files can be found in the <strong>DataSeq</strong> directory.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="k-mers-database-file">
<h2><em>k</em>-mers database file<a class="headerlink" href="#k-mers-database-file" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The final step in the customised database build is to generate the virus <em>k</em>-mers database file from the downloaded viral sequences.
In this step, <em>k</em>-mers from the viral sequences and from the host genomes are extracted. Low entropy and host <em>k</em>-mers are then removed
from the virus <em>k</em>-mers. The remaining set of virus <em>k</em>-mers are assigned the taxIDs of all the viruses which are represented by these
<em>k</em>-mers. Table 3 shows an example of the virus <em>k</em>-mer database file.</p>

<h2>An example<a class="headerlink" href="#an-example" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>This section shows an example of the whole process to create the customised <em>k</em>-mers database files. The NCBI dump files:
<em>names.dmp</em> and <em>nodes.dmp</em> must be downloaded from the NCBI into the <em>customisedDB</em> folder before starting the process.
In addition, the <em>lib</em> folder must be in the same directory as the <em>customisedDB</em> folder. The input files provided in
the <em>TestData</em> are used in this example. There are two input files:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>miniDB_sample.txt: contains information of the viruses used to build the <em>k</em>-mers database.</li>
<li>HumanGenomesTest.fa: contains an example of the host sequences</li>
</ol>
<p>The process starts by downloading the data from the NCBI and generating the reference genome file. Filtering of shared
sequences is then applied on a copy of the viral sequences. The last step is creating the virus <em>k</em>-mers database with
k size equals to 18 and 0 entropy threshold. The number of threads to count <em>k</em>-mers is 2 and the number of files to
process at once is 10. The given name for the customised database files in this example is “miniDB_sample”.</p>
