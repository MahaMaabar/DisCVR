# Overview
DisCVR is a user-friendly tool for detecting known viruses in clinical samples. It works by creating a viral database of _k_-mers (22 nucleotide sequences) from a set of known sequence is created. These _k_-mers are taxonomically labelled according to the viruses from which they originated. Each read in the sample is then screened for the presence of _k_-mers in the viral database, and a list of all viruses with _k_-mers found in the sample is shown. 

DisCVR is a fast, accurate viral detection tool designed to analyse HTS data and validate the results interactively on computers that have limited resources. At present, DisCVR is a human viral diagnostic tool, but it could be readily extended to include non-viral human pathogens and pathogens of other hosts.
